how the game should interact

click a box (left click) = fill. click again unfills
boundaries all drawn out.


inside canvas, entire thing is made up of tiles.
tiles for the instructions, as well as the game board.
class for different tiles, one for clickable, one for not

imagine huge grid of tiles
the clickable grid doesn't start until 
	largest instr from row, largest instr from col
for ex, if biggest instr from row is 4, biggest from col is 6
	clickable grid (0,0) starts at (6,4) 


use create_text and middlel coordinates of box for instructions
probably have instruction box inhereit from boxgui
overwrite draw method so that the lines are drawn top/bot or left/right


finished so far:
	proper printing / click feature to turn on off
	finish click and drag
	finished making 5th line bold

need to add:
	check solution / add button
	work on spcaing. make instructions take less room
		maybe change format so it's one line of text
		instead of several boxes


	maybe add image to top left
	work on option screen

	come up with better color scheme
